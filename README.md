This application serves as a demonstration of author's skills in building a web
application using the [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/). Creating the application
was a mandatory element of a semester-long course _Distributed Systems and Service Integration_
conducted at the [Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology](https://www.pja.edu.pl/en/).

Having cloned the repository you can run the application locally and access it
via the `http://localhost:8081/api` endpoint.
There are two entities implemented: *ExchangeRates* and *DataSources*. You can
recreate requests using the attached Postman collection (the _postman_collection.json_ file).
